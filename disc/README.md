# SpotTubeBot - Discord

This is a discord re-implementation of my Telegram bot , [SpotTubeBot](https://t.me/SpotTubeBot), which converts spotify links to YouTube ones, allowing for the quick and easy sharing of your favorite music with those who don't have spotify accounts.

## Install

Just click this link to add the bot to your own server!

## Usage

The bot has 2 modes: auto convert and single conversion.

1. In **auto convert**, the bot will convert every spotify link it sees in the given channel to a YouTube link. This may be useful in a music bot channel or just music sharing one, really anyplace where lots of messages are sent.
For this to work, the bot has to see every message sent in said channel. I don't log any of them or anything, but if that's a concern you can use the other mode.  
**To Enable** auto convert, type `/autoconvert` in the desired channel, and it'll start watching!  

2. In **command** mode, the bot will convert the specified spotify link given in a command. To access this, just use the slash command `/convert <spotify_link>`. That's it!

# Self-Hosting

To be written, but there's probably a docker image somewhere you can use.
